    <p><b>Seasonal flowers</b> are those that bloom during a specific time of the year, or season.Seasonal flowers are those that bloom during a particular time of the year, dictated by the natural cycles of weather and climate. They are generally at their peak in quality and freshness when in season,
         making them more vibrant and long-lasting in bouquets.  
        You'll see different flowers in different seasons because some
         flowers are naturally adapted to bloom in warmer weather, while others prefer cooler temperatures or even freezing conditions.Also, <b>“seasonal flowers”</b> is a term that has emerged in contrast to what’s available in the global flower marketplace.  That’s because flowers, for most people, are purchased from grocery stores, florists and on-line distributors relying on the global flower trade.  Because the global flower trade involves flowers grown in all kinds of climates across the world, consumers in the U.S. can obtain, <i>for example,</i> roses and peonies in the <u>Winter</u> and chrysanthemums in July.</p>

        <p>Tulips, with their vibrant colors and graceful curves, are a beloved symbol of spring and renewal. These iconic flowers, known for their cup-shaped petals and diverse hues, have a rich history and a place in both gardens and culture. From their origins in Persia and Turkey to their global popularity, tulips continue to captivate with their beauty and symbolism.Tulips are spring-blooming perennial herbaceous bulbiferous geophytes in the Tulipa genus. Their flowers are usually large, showy, and brightly coloured, generally red, orange, pink, yellow, or white. They often have a different coloured blotch at the base of the tepals, internally. Because of a degree of variability within the populations and a long history of cultivation, classification has been complex and controversial. The tulip is a member of the lily family, Liliaceae,[2] along with 14 other genera, where it is most closely related to Amana, Erythronium, and Gagea in the tribe Lilieae.

There are about 75 species, and these are divided among four subgenera. The name "tulip" is thought to be derived from a Persian word for turban, which it may have been thought to resemble by those who discovered it.[3] Tulips were originally found in a band stretching from Southern Europe to Central Asia, but since the seventeenth century have become widely naturalised and cultivated (see map). In their natural state, they are adapted to steppes and mountainous
 areas with temperate climates. Flowering in the spring, they become dormant in the summer once the flowers and leaves die back, emerging above ground as a shoot from the underground bulb in early spring.
<ol>The genus, which includes about 75 species, is divided into four subgenera. <li>Clusianae (4 species)</li>
<li>Orithyia (4 species)</li>
<li>Tulipa (52 species)</li>

<p>Sunflowers are useful plants with large flower heads, or blooms. They are named for the way they turn their blooms from east to west to follow the Sun. Sunflowers were first grown in North and South America. Today they are also grown in other parts of the world, including Europe and Asia.
Sunflowers are giants among flowers. The rough, hairy stem grows from 3 to 15 feet (1 to 4.5 meters) tall. The leaves are wide, rough, and 3 to 12 inches (8 to 30 centimeters) long.
The bloom of a sunflower has two parts. The center is a disk of small flowers packed closely together. The disk flowers are brown, yellow, or purple. The flowers around the outside are called ray flowers. They are golden yellow. Some sunflowers have disks that are 12 inches (30 centimeters) wide.
Sunflower plants have many uses. The flowers make a yellow dye. The leaves are used to feed animals. Seeds that come from the disk flowers contain a sweet, yellow oil. Sunflower oil is used in cooking and in making soaps and paints. Many people eat dried or roasted sunflower seeds as a snack.
Some varieties of sunflowers have one big head or flower. They are usually the giant sunflower varieties. Other large headed varieties, have a few much smaller heads that form on lower branches. Some varieties have multiple heads. These are typically mid-sized sunflowers, and are perfect for flower gardens in attracting birds.
Sunflower seeds are usually a dark brown to black, or large, grey and white striped. The latter is the most popular for eating due, to their large size. Don 't worry over selection. The birds will eat ample quantities of both, and so will you. Whether you are feeding the wildlife or not, there are plenty of wildlife that enjoy sunflower. They include all sorts of birds of course, squirrels, and rodents.

<p>Camellia (pronounced /kəˈmɛliə/[2] or /kəˈmiːliə/[3]) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Theaceae.[1] They are found in tropical and subtropical areas in eastern and southern Asia, from the Himalayas east to Japan and Indonesia. There are more than 220 described species;[1] almost all are found in southern China and Indochina.[4]: 66  Camellias are popular ornamental, tea, and woody-oil plants cultivated worldwide for centuries. Over 26,000 cultivars, with more than 51,000 cultivar names, including synonyms, have been registered or published.[5][6]
The leaves of C. sinensis are processed to create tea, and so are of particular economic importance in East Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Indian subcontinent, with the processed leaves widely sold and consumed globally. The ornamental C. japonica, C. sasanqua and their hybrids are the source of hundreds of garden cultivars. Coleifera produces tea seed oil, used in cooking and cosmetics.
Furthermore, different colors of camellias carry their own symbolism. Red camellias represent love and deep passion, white camellias symbolize purity and innocence, pink camellias convey admiration and appreciation, yellow camellias represent happiness and joy, and mixed color camellias symbolize a combination of emotions or messages.
Throughout history, camellias have held cultural significance in different parts of the world. For example, in Japanese culture, camellias are associated with the samurai spirit and are considered symbols of beauty and perfection. In Chinese culture, they symbolize wealth and fortune. In Korean culture, they represent faithfulness and loving devotion. Even in the Victorian era, camellias held symbolic meanings in the language of flowers.</p>

<P>John Steinbeck's "The Chrysanthemums" explores themes of societal expectations, female autonomy, and the search for identity through the symbolic lens of Elisa Allen and her chrysanthemums. Elisa, a woman frustrated with her limited life on the ranch, finds solace and a sense of purpose in tending her beautiful chrysanthemums, which symbolize her children, her pride, and her desire for a more fulfilling life.The name chrysanthemum means “golden flower” in Latin. Actually, the colors range from pale yellow to chestnut or from pink to crimson, and many varieties are white. The flower heads may be single, like daisies, or double. In size they range from tiny pompons to immense hothouse flowers. The plants are rather coarse and strongly scented. They are usually reproduced from cuttings.
Chrysanthemums were highly developed in China and Japan long before they were brought to Europe. Seeds from Korea were sent to Japan in the 4th century ad, and the flower has long been an emblem of the Japanese imperial house.
The genus Chrysanthemum belongs to the family Asteraceae (sometimes referred to as Compositae). Most popular in gardens is the buttonlike pompon, a form of the florists’ C. morifolium. Single-flowered types include the large white Shasta daisy and moon daisies (C. maximum), the small white feverfews (C. parthenium), and the gaudy tricolor (C. carinatum).
Popular florists’ varieties of chrysanthemums are the pyrethrums, or painted daisies (C. coccineum), and the white or lemon-colored marguerites, or Paris daisies (C. frutescens). Feverfew and pyrethrum are used in insecticides.</p>
